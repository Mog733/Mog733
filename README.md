- 👀 I’m interested in finding a group of game developers who have the technical know how to facilitate the creation of 3 independant games.
- These 3 games will give a set of instructions that must be understood but can only be understood if you play all three.
- This is not a joke, and my request is for real.
- If you are serious in taking part, you will be filled in on the details after the initial introduction.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity C#, and seriously need help, beyond ChatGpt. I have the vision, but none of the know how, I'm looking for talent.
- If you know coding, digital art, modeling, writing, story telling, or have fully functioning games out in the market, then you fit my criteria.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a series of games designed to deliver a set of instructions to the entire world.
- 📫 Email me to introduce yourself before trying to reach me directly mog3777@gmail.com
